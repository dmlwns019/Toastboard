## 11/4/2025 - Created a prototype CAD design with Fusion  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODUxOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--d73fbcca372b903b6cbdc662ba8d363e58288ae5/image.png)

After some sketching of the very basic version of the Toastboard modules, today I made a proof-of-concept design in Fusion 360 to show the size, modularization, and basic functions. 

The image shows the interlocking sections of the Toastboard modules, and an example servo motor component to show how components fit into the Toastboard itself. The colors represent the different electrical signals represented by an RGB LED.

Today's work involved lots of trial and error when it came to size measurements, and used lots (a lot) of paper to try and sketch what a real-life Toastboard would look like. Next steps are sketching and modelling more components and starting work on the electrical aspect of the project.
