# Toastboard

## Toastboard is a smart modular breadboard, microcontroller, and component system aimed at helping primary school kids understand electronic engineering in a visual way. 

Like puzzle pieces, Toastboard modules click together to create breadboard-like systems. One Toastboard module contains a microcontroller and an RGB LED allowing signals to be intuitively communicated through colors. Special components are also designed, such as:
- Servo motors
- LEDs
- Sensors, including infared, buttons, switches, etc.
- Relays
- And more, to aid children in learning electrical engineering!

Toastboard also has a unique wiring system, consisting of electrical signals passed through magnets, which can plug into a hub based off of an Arduino. The hub can be programmed by either phone or computer, using either a block-based or text-based program. 

### For accessibility, my goal is to find the most efficient and affordable method to creating Toastboards to give a universal education experience. I am currently experimenting with different methods to power and connect Toastboards, whether it be using microcontrollers or PCBs.
